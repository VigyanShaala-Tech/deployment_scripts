This folder contains scripts used for production-level data maintenance — primarily focused on two major tasks:  
1. **Data Cleaning & Standardization** – Fixing inconsistencies, removing duplicates, and correcting invalid entries.  
2. **Data Correction** – Repairing database records, filling missing values, and updating data directly in production.


- # old_data_insertion_scripts:

These scripts are used for inserting past data for old cohorts (Incubator 1 to Incubator 6) into the database to ensure completeness before live monitoring begins.
